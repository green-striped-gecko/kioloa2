We go over Fst where a lot of the foundation population genetic theory was developed, PCA used for data exploration, and structure which uses genetic models to detect structure of populations. Although isolation-by-distance is a foundational model of genetic structure, it is not included here as it will be included in a future session.\n\n\nPrerquisites\nYou should have the dartR.popgen package installed and have your head around genetic diversity metrics and SNP datasets.\n\nlibrary(dartRverse)\n# dartRverse_install(package = 'dartR.popgen')\nlibrary(dartR.popgen)\n\n\n\nWorkflow\nFirst there will be a presentation introducing the topic (click to download). There will then be brief introductions into the topics as a refresher of the presentation. Then we will run through the worked examples and finally you will be left to do some exercises on your own, or even try some of what you learnt on your own data. To finish we will wind up the session with a friendly discussion and summarise where we have come.\n\n\nAdditional reading\nGeorges et al.(2023)\nBattey, Ralph, and Kern (2020)"

    "section": "FST",
    "text": "FST\nFST quantifies genetic differentiation among populations. It represents the proportion of total genetic variation attributable to allele frequency differences between populations.\n\nFST = 0 → populations have identical allele frequencies.\nFST close to 1 → populations are fixed for different alleles.\nIntermediate values reflect varying levels of differentiation driven by gene flow, drift, selection, and demographic history.\n\n\nFST = between‑population variance / total genetic variance\n\nFST is an essential statistic in population genetics because it helps researchers detect barriers to gene flow, identify population structure, and evaluate how connected or isolated populations are in conservation contexts. It also provides insight into key evolutionary processes—including genetic drift, migration, and natural selection—by quantifying how allele frequencies differ among populations. Beyond this, F_ST offers a baseline expectation for interpreting genome-wide patterns, making it a valuable reference point for outlier detection and landscape genomics analyses.\n\nFST does not directly measure gene flow, though it is strongly influenced by it.\n\n\n\n5. Common Misconceptions\n\nFST equals gene flow → False. FST reflects multiple processes, not only migration.\nLow FST means no structure → False. Subtle structure can exist with low genome-wide differentiation.\nHigh FST means selection → Not necessarily. Drift can also cause high differentiation.\nCompare FST across species → Generally invalid due to differing heterozygosity, genome architecture, and mutation rates."

    "text": "PCA\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction, data visualization, and feature extraction. In many real-world datasets, like our SNP datasets, data can have a very high number of features or dimensions. PCA helps by transforming the data into a new coordinate system where most of the variability in the data can be captured in fewer dimensions.\nAt its core, PCA identifies the directions (called principal components) along which the variation in the data is highest. These directions are orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other and are ranked by how much variance they capture from the original data. By projecting data onto the top few principal components, we can often retain the most important information while discarding noise or less useful details."

    "section": "Structure",
    "text": "Structure\nStructure attempts to find the number of populations or sources (K) at which population genetics parameters (i.e. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium within populations and linkage equilibrium between loci) are maximized.\n\nAdmixture Model\n\nDefinition: The admixture model assumes that individuals can have ancestry from multiple populations. This means that the genetic makeup of an individual can be a mixture of two or more populations. This model is particularly useful for analyzing genetic data from populations that are known to have mixed or where there is gene flow between populations.\nApplication: It is applied when there is historical or recent admixture between populations, and it allows for the estimation of individual ancestry proportions from each of the inferred clusters. For example, an individual might be 50% from population A, 30% from population B, and 20% from population C under the admixture model.\nUtility: The admixture model can uncover complex patterns of genetic structure that are not apparent under the assumption of discrete, non-overlapping populations.\n\n\n\nNo-Admixture Model\n\nDefinition: The no-admixture model assumes that individuals have ancestry from only one population. This model is particularly useful for analyzing genetic data from populations that are known to be isolated from one another.\nApplication: This model is used in situations where populations are relatively well-defined and isolated, with little to no gene flow between them. It simplifies the analysis by considering that an individual’s entire genetic information originates from one of the K clusters without any mixture.\nUtility: The no-admixture model is useful for identifying distinct populations and their members, especially in cases where populations are clearly separated geographically or temporally.\n\nTo run STRUCTURE from within R, we need to download the non-GUI executable (the version without frontend) for your operating system [e.g windows, mac or linux]. You can download STRUCTURE for your OS from web.stanford.edu."
