# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the second dartR workshop hosted at Kioloa \~ Kioloa2!

**Welcome, Fellow Magical Beings**, to our 5-day spellbinding journey in the mystical realm of Population Genetics using the ancient art of R! We’re over the moon (and not just because we’ve mastered levitation spells) to have you join us at the enchanted **Kioloa ANU Coastal Campus**. Nestled among the spellbound forests of Murramarang Nation Park and the crystal-clear waters of southern New South Wales, our meeting lair couldn’t be more perfect. When you’re not weaving R spells, you’ll find yourself spoiled for choice with magical brews (a.k.a. coffee) and breathtaking sceneries.

## A big thank you to the developers!
