## Introduction

```{r  ex21d, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# Numeric scalar
num <- 6
num
class(num)
```


```{r  ex212d, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "ex21d", exercise.eval.setup = TRUE}
# Numeric scalar

num
yy <- 43 + num

```


```{r  ex212ddd, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "ex212d"}
# Numeric scalar

num+1

yy

```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# We show them the code to run

print(x)
```


## Exercises

Exercises where they can use their own data or supplied data to try out what they have learnt in a new context.

- dot points 
- for different steps

## Winding up



### Discussion Time

Add some questions to help group discussion.

```{r results='markup'}
# Access multiple specific elements
width[c(1,3,4)]

# Access consecutive elements using colon
width[1:4]

# Access all except specified elements (negative indexing)
width[c(-2,-5)]

# Access first and last elements
width[c(1,length(width))]

# Access elements greater than 6 
width[width > 6] 

# Access elements equal to specific values 
names[names == "Alice"] 

```

### Where have we come?

Summarise what they should have learnt.
