## Learning outcomes

In this session we will learn how to run simulations within the dartRverse. 

## Introduction

### Using simulations in the dartRverse for conservation genetics

Simulation is one of the most powerful yet underused tools in conservation genetics. While empirical SNP datasets tell us what *has happened*, simulations allow us to ask *what could happen* under alternative management scenarios—and to do so quickly, transparently, and reproducibly. Within the **dartRverse**, simulations are designed as lightweight, modular building blocks that integrate naturally with SNP-based analyses used in applied conservation genetics.

At its core, the dartRverse simulation framework is not intended to compete with full forward-time population genetic simulators. Instead, it aims to provide **rapid, interpretable simulations** that allow conservation practitioners and researchers to explore genetic consequences of simplified demographic and management scenarios using the same data structures and summary statistics they already use for real populations.

---

#### Why simulate in a conservation context?

Many conservation questions are fundamentally *dynamic*:

- How quickly will a small population lose genetic variation through drift?
- How many generations does it take to lose 50% of heterozygosity under a given effective population size?
- How effective is supplementation or translocation at preserving allelic diversity?
- How fast do populations diverge when connectivity is reduced?
- How do metapopulation dynamics influence genetic differentiation, inbreeding, or genetic rescue outcomes?

Simulations allow these questions to be explored explicitly, often with simple assumptions, before committing to costly or irreversible management actions.

---

#### A modular, “lego-style” simulation philosophy

The dartRverse approaches simulations as a sequence of **simple, composable processes**. Rather than defining an entire demographic model upfront, users build scenarios by chaining together a small number of intuitive functions—much like assembling lego pieces.

At a conceptual level, simulations revolve around four core processes:

##### 1. Population creation  
Populations can be generated *de novo* or derived directly from empirical SNP datasets. This allows simulations to begin from realistic allele frequencies, levels of heterozygosity, and population structure, rather than abstract starting conditions.

##### 2. Drift and mutation  
Allele frequencies change over generations due to genetic drift, with optional mutation. Even under extremely simple population dynamics, this immediately illustrates how small effective population sizes rapidly erode genetic diversity—often far faster than expected.

##### 3. Survival and migration  
Individuals can survive, be removed, or migrate between populations. This enables exploration of connectivity, fragmentation, and metapopulation dynamics without invoking complex spatially explicit models.

##### 4. Reproduction  
Reproduction can be modelled through simple cloning or sexual reproduction, allowing users to explore consequences for heterozygosity, inbreeding, and relatedness under different mating systems.

Each step produces SNP data in familiar dartR objects, making it trivial to calculate standard diversity metrics at any point in the simulation.

---

#### Building complexity incrementally

A key strength of this approach is that **complex dynamics emerge from simple rules**. By combining basic processes, users can rapidly construct realistic conservation scenarios, such as:

- Periodic supplementation (e.g. adding individuals every five generations)
- Founder events followed by isolation
- Asymmetric migration between source and sink populations
- Temporary corridors that restore gene flow for limited time periods

Because simulations are embedded in R, users can easily extend them further—for example by introducing sex- or age-dependent survival, stochastic catastrophes, or spatial structure linked to resistance surfaces and home ranges.

---

#### Typical conservation genetics use cases

Some common applications of dartRverse simulations include:

- **Genetic drift over time**  
  Tracking loss of heterozygosity or allelic richness across generations under different effective population sizes.

- **Supplementation and genetic rescue**  
  Evaluating how many individuals are required, and how often, to maintain genetic diversity or slow inbreeding.

- **Metapopulation dynamics**  
  Exploring how migration rates influence differentiation, extinction–recolonisation dynamics, and long-term persistence.

- **Temporal change in population structure**  
  Monitoring trajectories of population differentiation, relatedness, or inbreeding coefficients as populations diverge or reconnect.

Because simulated datasets are analysed using the same summary statistics as empirical SNP data, results are immediately interpretable and directly comparable to real monitoring data.

---

#### From exploration to decision support

Ultimately, simulations in the dartRverse allow conservation geneticists to test assumptions, visualise outcomes, and communicate genetic risks and benefits to managers and stakeholders. Even highly simplified simulations can provide powerful insights into how quickly genetic diversity can be lost—and how strategic interventions can slow, or even reverse, that loss. In this way, simulations become not just a teaching tool, but a practical component of evidence-based conservation decision-making.



Please be aware dartRverse is not a fully fledged simulation tool. It allows to do quick and easy simulations, but for a comprehensive simulation framework you should consider using `SLIM`. By the way there is a cool package called 'slimR' which allows to integrate and run simulations from within R (and it talk to the dartRverse for analysis).


## Prerequisites and background knowledge

Simulations in the dartRverse can range from very simple to highly complex. At the simplest level, many conservation scenarios can be explored using built-in dartRverse functions with minimal coding, making simulations accessible to users with basic R skills. More advanced applications, however, require custom workflows written directly in R, where dartRverse functions are combined with user-defined logic to represent realistic demographic, genetic, or management processes.

As a result, **a working knowledge of R programming and familiarity with dartR data objects** (e.g. `genlight`, `dartR' and related structures) is essential. Simulations often require small but important data transformations, such as subsetting populations, updating metadata, reshaping outputs, or tracking summary statistics across generations. When individual simulation runs become computationally intensive—particularly when stochasticity is important—it is common to repeat simulations hundreds or thousands of times. In these cases, **parallelisation** (using standard R tools) becomes critical for keeping runtimes practical.

Finally, simulations are only as informative as the questions they are designed to address. Users therefore need a solid understanding of **population genetic concepts** and appropriate metrics for quantifying genetic change. This includes knowing when to track heterozygosity, allelic richness, inbreeding, or population differentiation, and how these measures relate to processes such as drift, migration, and supplementation. Thoughtful choice of summary statistics is key to translating simulation outputs into meaningful conservation insights.

## Setup

```{r start, include=FALSE}
library(learnr)
library(dartRverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
tutorial_options(exercise.eval = FALSE)


#tutorial specific

rfbe <- readRDS("./data/rfbe.rds")

```

To setup the session, we need to load the necessary libraries. The main one is `dartRverse` which contains all the functions we will use for simulations and analysis. We also load `ggplot2` and `tidyr` for data manipulation and visualization. Make sure you have these packages installed and loaded before proceeding with the tutorial and also make sure the `dartRverse` package is up to date, as the simulation functions are relatively new and may have been updated since the last release.

```{r loadlibs,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dartRverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```

## Tutorial

```{r ex_71-setup, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rfbe <- readRDS("./data/rfbe.rds")
source <- gl.keep.pop(rfbe, pop.list="PJTub1.2.3", verbose = 0)
source2 <- gl.filter.callrate(source, method="loc", threshold=1, verbose=0)
set.seed(7)
newpop <- gl.subsample.ind(source2, n=10, replace = FALSE, verbose = 0)


```


### Step 1: A minimal simulation

The dartRverse allows to run time forward simulations. Often you want to run some simulation based on an existing genlight object.

We load some example data

```{r ex_71_1, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, exercise.lines=5}
rfbe <- readRDS("./data/rfbe.rds")

```





and then run the gl.report.basics function to check its content. Have a look at the output and feel free to explore the dataset further using other functions. You can for example check the the amount of missing data or the number of individuals in each population.


```{r  ex71_2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup="ex_71-setup", class.chunk="gold-panel"}
gl.report.basics(rfbe)
```


The next step is to think about a simulation scenario. Here we come up with a very simple one:

<div class="callout">
#### Scenario
A new population is founded by translocating ten individuals from one of the populations in the data set (PJTub1.2.3). The population evolves for 15 generations under a drift-only Wright–Fisher process with no sexual reproduction, no mutation, and no additional releases, allowing us to examine the loss of heterozygosity through time.
</div>


So lets create a new population from the existing one by subsetting the dartR object and then subsample 10 individuals from it.

```{r ex71_3, eval=TRUE}
# copy only the source population int a new dartR object
source <- gl.keep.pop(rfbe, pop.list="PJTub1.2.3")

```

Next, we inspect the source population to determine the number of individuals and the extent of missing data. 

```{r ex71_4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup="ex_71-setup", class.chunk="gold-panel"}
### number of individuals in the source population

### missing data in the genotypes of the source population

```


As you can see there is missing data in the source population.

Missing genotypes are generally undesirable in simulations, as they require explicit assumptions about how missing alleles are handled during reproduction. To avoid introducing additional complexity at this stage, we remove loci with missing data by filtering (an alternative approach would be genotype imputation). In most simulation studies, it is preferable to work with complete datasets; however, there are situations where the effects of missing data are themselves of interest, in which case an explicit strategy for handling missingness is required.


```{r ex71_5}
#remove missing data using a strict callrate filter
source2 <- gl.filter.callrate(source, method="loc", threshold=1)

```


```{r ex71_6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="ex_71-setup", class.chunk="gold-panel"}
#check if there are no missing data in the genotypes of source2


```

The next step is to create a new population of 10 individuals using the source2 population


```{r ex71_7}
# create a new population of 10 individuals using individuals from source2  
set.seed(7)
newpop <- gl.subsample.ind(source2, n=10, replace = FALSE, verbose = 0)
```



```{r ex71_8, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="ex_71-setup", class.chunk="gold-panel"}
#check number of individuals and missing data in newpop

```





As we want to observe the change in heterozygosity we calculate heterozygosity for this populuation

```{r ex71_9, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="ex_71-setup", class.chunk="gold-panel" }
#find a way to calculate the mean heterozygosity of the new population



```



The next step is then repeat this for 15 generations (assuming an ideal poulation for simplicity)

```{r ex71_10}

#we create a vector that holds heterozygosity over generation
res <- NA
#He of Generation 1
res[1] <- mean(gl.He(newpop))

for (gen in 2:15)
{
  #ideal popluation = cloning snails
  newpop <- gl.sim.ind(newpop, n=10)
  
  #He of generation gen
  res[gen] <- mean(gl.He(newpop))
  cat("Generation", gen, "Heterozygosity:", res[gen], "\n")
  flush.console()
}
#Create a plot
plot(res, type="b", xlab="Generation", ylab="Expected heterozygosity", 
     main="Simulation of expected heterozygosity over time")

```



You can now change setting and play with the simulation. For example increase the number of generations or the number of initial founding individuals. You need to run the golden chunks in order to make sure all the objects are updated.

Here is the full simulation in one code block. Change to your liking. Eg. run more generations, or how does the simulation change if you sample from less/more individuals from the source, change the source population. Monitor observerd heterozygosity instead of experced.


```{r ex71_11, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="ex_71-setup", class.chunk="gold-panel"}

rfbe <- readRDS("./data/rfbe.rds")
source <- gl.keep.pop(rfbe, pop.list="PJTub1.2.3", verbose=0)
source2 <- gl.filter.callrate(source, method="loc", threshold=1, verbose=0)
set.seed(7)
newpop <- gl.subsample.ind(source2, n=10, replace = FALSE, verbose = 0)
res<-NA
res[1] <- mean(gl.He(newpop))

for (gen in 2:15)
{
  #ideal popluation = cloning snails
  newpop <- gl.sim.ind(newpop, n=10)
  #He of generation gen
  res[gen] <- mean(gl.He(newpop))
}

plot(res, type="b", xlab="Generation", ylab="Expected heterozygosity", 
     main="Simulation of expected heterozygosity over time")

```
